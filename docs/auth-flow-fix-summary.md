# Authentication Implementation Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to the multi-user authentication implementation.

## Major Issues Fixed

1. **API Key Injection** 
   - Fixed controllers to inject `llmApiKey` from `req.user` into `session.state.coreSessionState.llmApiKey`
   - Now properly populates session state before calls to `startSession` and `processQuery`

2. **Single-User Mode Response Codes**
   - Adjusted all `/auth/*` routes to return 404 in single-user mode
   - Added `authRequired` flag to responses for better client handling
   - Updated UI components to properly handle different authentication modes

3. **Security Improvements**
   - Replaced `Math.random()` token generation with cryptographic `crypto.randomUUID()`
   - Changed device authentication tracking from IP-based to device-code based
   - Eliminated storing user LiteLLM keys on disk in multi-user mode

4. **User Management**
   - Added automatic expiration for inactive users (24-hour TTL)
   - Implemented hourly cleanup of expired users

## Implementation Details

### Auth Flow

The authentication flow now works as follows:

1. **Single-User Mode** (when `AUTH_URL` is not set):
   - All `/auth/*` routes return 404 with `authRequired: false`
   - UI automatically skips login and proceeds to main app
   - `SingleUserManager` provides a no-op implementation that always returns the global key

2. **Multi-User Mode** (when `AUTH_URL` is set):
   - Client visits login page and starts device code flow
   - Device code is used as key for tracking authentication
   - After successful authentication, the client gets redirected with the device code
   - User context middleware checks for a token tied to the device code
   - User-specific LLM API key is attached to requests and injected into session state

### API Controllers

The controllers were updated to extract the API key from the authenticated request and inject it into the session state before making SDK calls, fixing the main functional issue:

```typescript
// Add user's LLM API key to session state if authenticated
const user = (req as AuthenticatedRequest).user;
if (user?.llmApiKey && session.state.coreSessionState) {
  session.state.coreSessionState.llmApiKey = user.llmApiKey;
  serverLogger.debug(`Added user-specific LLM API key to session ${session.id}`, LogCategory.AUTH);
}
```

### User Security

Security improvements include:

1. **Token Generation**: Using cryptographically secure random UUIDs
2. **Authentication Tracking**: Using device codes instead of IP addresses
3. **User Expiration**: Automatic removal of inactive user records
4. **Cookie Security**: HTTP-only, secure cookies with same-site protection

## Further Improvements

While these fixes address the immediate issues, future improvements could include:

1. Persistent storage for user information
2. Automatic token refresh mechanism
3. Admin interface for user management
4. More granular permissions system
5. Rate limiting for authentication attempts
