# Agent as Judge: AI Evaluation Methodology

## Why Use an AI Judge?

Traditional quantitative metrics (success rates, execution time, token usage) provide valuable but limited insights. An AI judge offers qualitative assessment of:

- Correctness and completeness of solutions
- Process and problem-solving strategies
- Code quality and readability
- Explanation clarity and helpfulness
- Tool usage efficiency and appropriateness

## Key Capabilities

### Post-Execution Exploration
Unlike simple metrics, our judge can continue exploring the codebase after the agent-under-test completes:

- Examine implemented changes in detail
- Discover missed opportunities or better approaches
- Understand why certain tools were chosen
- Assess how changes impact the broader system
- Gain deeper context than what's visible in execution history

### Code Validation
The judge can actively validate work by running:

- Tests to verify functionality
- Type checkers to confirm type safety
- Linters to check code style and best practices
- Build processes to ensure the project remains functional

## Evaluation Process

1. Judge receives the task description, execution history, and agent's solution
2. Explores the post-execution codebase to validate changes
3. Runs code quality tools as needed
4. Scores on dimensions like correctness, efficiency, code quality
5. Provides qualitative feedback on strengths and weaknesses

## Current Challenges

- **Consistency**: Variable judgments between runs
- **Biases**: May favor certain coding styles or approaches
- **Limited context**: May not fully understand complex codebases
- **Validation depth**: Varies based on test coverage and available tools

## Future Improvements

### Thinking Models
Models with explicit reasoning capabilities (Sonnet-3.7 with thinking, O3-mini, DeepSeek R1) could improve:

- Transparency in evaluation reasoning
- Methodical assessment of different dimensions
- Self-critique and bias reduction

### Enhanced Capabilities
Future versions could include:

- Improved test and validation tooling
- Multi-judge consensus to reduce bias
- Human calibration to maintain standards
- More granular evaluation criteria

## Conclusion

The AI judge approach extends beyond simple metrics by exploring codebases, running validation tools, and providing nuanced feedback. While still evolving, it offers a valuable middle ground between automated metrics and human review.
