It lacks a systematic methodology for narrowing down the search space, often failing to use targeted search patterns or recursive options that would locate files more quickly. The agent's approach to directory exploration appears reactive rather than strategic, resulting in a meandering search process that could benefit from better planning and more thoughtful tool selection.

- Experimental Agent: The Experimental Agent demonstrates inconsistent search strategies, often failing to use targeted grep patterns efficiently to locate relevant files, and tends to either explore too broadly without focus or abandon exploration prematurely before finding critical components. When successful in locating important files like permission.ts, the agent frequently provides superficial analysis without extracting specific code examples or detailed explanations of the implementation, missing opportunities to deliver comprehensive insights about the system's architecture. These weaknesses suggest the agent lacks a systematic approach to codebase exploration and struggles to balance breadth versus depth in its investigation process.
