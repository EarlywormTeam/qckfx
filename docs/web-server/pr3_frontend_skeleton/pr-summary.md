# PR3: Frontend Skeleton Summary

## Overview
This PR adds the basic frontend structure using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It sets up:

1. **Directory structure** for frontend code organization
2. **Build system** with Vite for development and production
3. **API client service** for frontend-backend communication
4. **Basic UI shell** with theme support
5. **Testing infrastructure** with Vitest and Testing Library

## Key Components

### Build System
- Configured Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- Added TypeScript support for frontend
- Set up hot module replacement
- Configured proxy for API communication during development

### API Integration
- Implemented service for REST API interactions
- Created React hooks for using API services in components

### UI Foundation
- Set up Tailwind CSS with dark/light theme support
- Added minimal UI shell
- Prepared directory structure for future UI components

### Testing
- Set up Vitest for component and service testing
- Added testing utilities and mock implementations

## Next Steps
This PR serves as the foundation for PR4, which will implement the terminal-like UI components using this infrastructure.
