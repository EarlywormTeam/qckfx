# Commit 1: Add WebSocket Service

## Summary
This commit introduces real-time WebSocket communication to enable live updates for agent operations. 
It utilizes Socket.io to create a bridge between the existing AgentService events and clients.

## Implementation Details

### WebSocketService

Created `src/server/services/WebSocketService.ts` which:
- Implements a singleton service pattern
- Integrates with Socket.io for real-time communication
- Connects with AgentService and SessionManager
- Maps all AgentService events to WebSocket events
- Supports session joining/leaving
- Handles client connections and disconnections
- Provides proper cleanup on server shutdown

### Server Integration

Updated `src/server/index.ts` to:
- Use a shared HTTP server for both Express and Socket.io
- Initialize WebSocketService after server starts
- Properly close WebSocket connections on server shutdown

### WebSocket Events

Implemented the following event types:
- CONNECT/DISCONNECT: Connection lifecycle events
- JOIN_SESSION/LEAVE_SESSION: Session management
- PROCESSING_STARTED/COMPLETED/ERROR/ABORTED: Query processing events
- TOOL_EXECUTION: Real-time tool execution updates
- PERMISSION_REQUESTED/RESOLVED: Permission flow events
- SESSION_UPDATED: Session state changes

### Testing

Added comprehensive tests:
- `src/server/services/__tests__/WebSocketService.test.ts` for unit testing the service
- Updated `src/server/__tests__/index.test.ts` to verify WebSocket integration

### Dependencies

Added Socket.io dependencies:
- socket.io: Server-side WebSocket implementation
- socket.io-client: Client-side WebSocket library (will be used by frontend)

## Next Steps

1. Implement the client-side WebSocket service
2. Create UI components for real-time updates
3. Add typing indicators and progress feedback
4. Implement reconnection and error handling
