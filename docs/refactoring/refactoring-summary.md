# Timeline and Tool Visualization Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to the timeline and tool visualization architecture in the qckfx UI. The refactoring aimed to eliminate redundancy by creating a single source of truth for all timeline data and separating concerns between data management and UI state.

## Key Changes

1. **Created TimelineContext**
   - Provides a centralized provider for timeline data
   - Wraps the existing `useTimeline` hook
   - Offers filtered access to timeline items by type (messages, tool executions)
   - Located at `src/ui/context/TimelineContext.tsx`

2. **Created useToolVisualization Hook**
   - Replaced the legacy `useToolStream` hook
   - Consumes data from TimelineContext rather than subscribing directly to WebSocket events
   - Manages UI-specific state for tool visualizations (view modes)
   - Located at `src/ui/hooks/useToolVisualization.ts`

3. **Updated MessageFeed Component**
   - Now consumes timeline data from TimelineContext
   - Uses useToolVisualization for tool visualization UI state
   - Simplified implementation by removing duplicate state management

4. **Updated ToolVisualization Components**
   - Updated ToolVisualization to use the new ToolVisualizationItem type
   - Updated ToolVisualizations to get data directly from useToolVisualization hook
   - Improved typing and removed redundancies

5. **Removed useToolStream**
   - Completely removed the legacy implementation
   - Updated all references to use the new architecture
   - Updated relevant tests to match the new API

6. **Created Documentation**
   - Added `docs/refactoring/timeline-architecture.md` to document the new architecture
   - Added this summary document

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: TimelineContext is now the single source of truth for all timeline data
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Data management and UI state are properly separated
3. **Reduced WebSocket Overhead**: Only one component subscribes to WebSocket events
4. **Simpler API**: Components have a more consistent and simpler API
5. **Better TypeScript Support**: Improved type definitions for all components
6. **Easier Testing**: Components can be tested with mocked context providers

## Future Considerations

While our current refactoring has significantly improved the architecture, there are a few areas that could be enhanced in the future:

1. **Real-time Updates**: Consider using React Query or a similar library for more robust data fetching and caching
2. **Performance Optimizations**: Add memoization for large lists of timeline items
3. **Pagination Support**: Enhance timeline context to better support pagination and infinite scrolling
4. **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure all new components meet WCAG accessibility standards
