## Quick Start

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here npx qckfx
```

## Core Features

1. **File Operations**: Read, edit, and create files in your codebase
2. **Code Search**: Find code with glob patterns and grep-like searches
3. **Bash Command Execution**: Run terminal commands with proper permission handling
4. **Interactive Chat**: Have multi-turn conversations with context preservation
5. **Claude Integration**: Powered by Anthropic's Claude models with tool calling

## Architecture

qckfx agent combines an intelligent LLM with a modular set of tools that interact with your development environment:

```
qckfx agent
â”œâ”€â”€ Core
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AgentRunner (orchestrates the entire process)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ToolRegistry (manages available tools)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PermissionManager (handles permission requests)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ModelClient (interacts with the LLM)
â”œâ”€â”€ Providers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AnthropicProvider (for Claude models)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (other providers)
â”œâ”€â”€ Tools
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BashTool
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GlobTool
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GrepTool
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LSTool
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FileReadTool
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FileEditTool
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ FileWriteTool
â””â”€â”€ Utils
    â”œâ”€â”€ Logger
    â”œâ”€â”€ Error Handling
    â””â”€â”€ Token Management 
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g qckfx

# Or run directly with npx
npx qckfx
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Terminal Usage

Just run the command and start chatting:

```bash
# With global installation
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here qckfx

# Or with npx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here npx qckfx
```

This will start an interactive session where you can chat with Claude. The agent can use a variety of tools to assist you with software development tasks.

# qckfx agent

This is a CLI-based AI software engineering assistant that runs in your terminal. It's designed to help developers with coding tasks by providing an AI assistant that can interact with your codebase.

## Key Features:

1. **File Operations**: The agent can read, edit, and create files in your codebase.
2. **Code Search**: It can find code using glob patterns and grep-like searches.
3. **Bash Command Execution**: It can run terminal commands with proper permission handling.
4. **Interactive Chat**: It supports multi-turn conversations with context preservation.
5. **Claude Integration**: It's powered by Anthropic's Claude models with tool calling capabilities.

## Architecture:

The project follows a modular, composition-based approach with these main components:

- **Core**: Includes AgentRunner (orchestrates the process), ToolRegistry (manages tools), PermissionManager (handles permissions), and ModelClient (interacts with the LLM).
- **Providers**: Currently includes AnthropicProvider for Claude models.
- **Tools**: Various tools like BashTool, GlobTool, GrepTool, LSTool, FileReadTool, FileEditTool, FileWriteTool, and ScratchpadTool.
- **Utils**: Includes Logger, Error Handling, and Token Management.

## Usage:

You can use it by running:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here npx qckfx
```

This starts an interactive session where you can chat with Claude. The agent can assist with various software development tasks like debugging, code generation, refactoring, codebase exploration, and testing.

The project is MIT licensed and is part of the qckfx platform, which also offers a hosted solution at qckfx.com for fixing GitHub issues asynchronously and autonomously.
```

### Advanced Use Cases

The agent excels at complex software development tasks:

- **Debugging**: "Why is this function returning undefined when I pass an empty array?"
- **Code Generation**: "Write a utility function that validates email addresses"
- **Refactoring**: "Help me convert this class component to a functional component"
- **Exploration**: "Explain how the routing works in this codebase"
- **Testing**: "Generate unit tests for this API endpoint"
