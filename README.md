## Quick Start

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here npx qckfx
```

## Core Features

1. **File Operations**: Read, edit, and create files in your codebase
2. **Code Search**: Find code with glob patterns and grep-like searches
3. **Bash Command Execution**: Run terminal commands with proper permission handling
4. **Interactive Chat**: Have multi-turn conversations with context preservation
5. **Claude Integration**: Powered by Anthropic's Claude models with tool calling

## Architecture

qckfx agent combines an intelligent LLM with a modular set of tools that interact with your development environment:

```
qckfx agent
â”œâ”€â”€ Core
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AgentRunner (orchestrates the entire process)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ToolRegistry (manages available tools)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PermissionManager (handles permission requests)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ModelClient (interacts with the LLM)
â”œâ”€â”€ Providers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AnthropicProvider (for Claude models)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (other providers)
â”œâ”€â”€ Tools
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BashTool
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GlobTool
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GrepTool
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LSTool
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FileReadTool
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FileEditTool
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ FileWriteTool
â””â”€â”€ Utils
    â”œâ”€â”€ Logger
    â”œâ”€â”€ Error Handling
    â””â”€â”€ Token Management 
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g qckfx

# Or run directly with npx
npx qckfx
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Terminal Usage

Just run the command and start chatting:

```bash
# With global installation
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here qckfx

# Or with npx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here npx qckfx
```

This will start an interactive session where you can chat with Claude. The agent can use a variety of tools to assist you with software development tasks.

### CLI Options

The qckfx CLI supports several options to customize your experience:

```bash
# Basic usage
qckfx [options]

Options:
  -h, --help               Display help information
  -v, --version            Display version information
  -d, --debug              Enable debug logging
  -q, --quiet              Minimal output, show only errors and results
  -m, --model <model>      Specify the Claude model to use (default: claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219)
  -e, --e2bSandboxId <id>  Run agent tools in an E2B sandbox (requires sandbox ID)
```

### E2B Integration

The E2B integration allows you to run agent tools in an isolated sandbox environment. This provides enhanced security and reproducibility as all file operations and command executions happen in the cloud-based sandbox instead of your local machine.

To use this feature:

1. Install the E2B SDK:
   ```bash
   npm install -g e2b
   ```

2. Create an E2B sandbox:
   ```bash
   e2b sbx sp
   ```
   This will create a sandbox and provide you with a sandbox ID.

3. Run qckfx with the E2B option:
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here qckfx -e <sandbox-id>
   ```

When running with the E2B integration, all tool operations (file reading/writing, command execution, etc.) will be performed in the isolated E2B sandbox rather than on your local machine.

# qckfx agent

This is a CLI-based AI software engineering assistant that runs in your terminal. It's designed to help developers with coding tasks by providing an AI assistant that can interact with your codebase.

## Key Features:

1. **File Operations**: The agent can read, edit, and create files in your codebase.
2. **Code Search**: It can find code using glob patterns and grep-like searches.
3. **Bash Command Execution**: It can run terminal commands with proper permission handling.
4. **Interactive Chat**: It supports multi-turn conversations with context preservation.
5. **Claude Integration**: It's powered by Anthropic's Claude models with tool calling capabilities.

## Architecture:

The project follows a modular, composition-based approach with these main components:

- **Core**: Includes AgentRunner (orchestrates the process), ToolRegistry (manages tools), PermissionManager (handles permissions), and ModelClient (interacts with the LLM).
- **Providers**: Currently includes AnthropicProvider for Claude models.
- **Tools**: Various tools like BashTool, GlobTool, GrepTool, LSTool, FileReadTool, FileEditTool, FileWriteTool, and ScratchpadTool.
- **Utils**: Includes Logger, Error Handling, and Token Management.

## Usage:

You can use it by running:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here npx qckfx
```

This starts an interactive session where you can chat with Claude. The agent can assist with various software development tasks like debugging, code generation, refactoring, codebase exploration, and testing.

The project is MIT licensed and is part of the qckfx platform, which also offers a hosted solution at qckfx.com for fixing GitHub issues asynchronously and autonomously.
```

### Advanced Use Cases

The agent excels at complex software development tasks:

- **Debugging**: "Why is this function returning undefined when I pass an empty array?"
- **Code Generation**: "Write a utility function that validates email addresses"
- **Refactoring**: "Help me convert this class component to a functional component"
- **Exploration**: "Explain how the routing works in this codebase"
- **Testing**: "Generate unit tests for this API endpoint"
